 <h1>Delicious Bites Menu</h1>

    <h2>Appetizers</h2>  

  <ul>     

   <li><strong>The Grilled Hawaiian</strong></li> 
   <p>Preheat grill to medium-high heat.  Poke each pineapple spear halfway on wooden skewer. Lightly brush each pineapple spear with oil; sprinkle with spiced chile rub on all sides.</p>  

   <li><strong>Goat Cheese and Strawberry Bruschetta</strong></li>
     <p>For different flavor, try stirring in ¼  tsp. cracked black pepper or ground chipotle chili pepper, or 1 tsp. finely chopped crystallized ginger. Herb-flavored goat cheese can be substituted for plain</p>

  <strong>Caprese Salad</strong>       

     <p>Fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil drizzled with balsamic glaze.</p> 

       </li>

   </ul>  

  <h2>Main Courses</h2> 

   <ul>   

     <li><strong>Braised Chicken Legs With Grapes and Fennel</strong></li>
     <p>Think of the grapes in this chicken recipe as something like a rustic way to braise chicken in wine. Here, though, you get all the flavor while saving your wine for drinking.</p>  

     <li><strong>Paneer Kathi Roll</strong></li>
     <p>Indian street food where lachha parathas are slathered with green chutney and stuffed with a spicy paneer bell pepper filling. Serve them for a filling meal any time of the day.</p> 

     <li><strong>Mac and Cheese</strong></li>
     <p>Mac And Cheese is rich, cheesy, creamy, and comforting served with a side of salad or roasted veggies or as a side dish with fried or grilled chicken or steak.</p>


      <strong>Grilled Salmon</strong>     

       <p>Salmon fillet seasoned and grilled to perfection, served with lemon butter sauce.</p>   

     </li>

   </ul>   

 <h2>Desserts</h2>  

  <ul>     

   <li><strong>Brownies</strong></li> 
    <p>Corner piece or slice from the middle of a mainstay treat, the base for sundaes and a seriously addictive ice cream flavor.</p>

    <li><strong>Gelato</strong></li> 
    <p>From shaved ice to sorbet, frozen desserts are melting evidence of one of the world’s great food truths there’s nothing so welcome as a cold, sugary treat on a summer afternoon.</p>



        <strong>Chocolate Fondue</strong>     

       <p>Assorted fruits and marshmallows served with rich chocolate fondue.</p>    

    </li>
